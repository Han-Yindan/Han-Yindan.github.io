<p>In the morning, I learned <strong>entity relationships</strong> in database, and this is the seventh champter.That a manner to help you to set up a module between two or more relationships. I mean although you may know some tables and the data of it, some of them have the relationships among each other. If you have** no official methods or general methods** to detect them, you may be confused to set up some keys like <strong>foreign keys</strong>, maybe there still exists some reasons.<br>
In the afternoon, I learned that** full-adder** can be constructed circut from two <strong>half-adder</strong>. And two of four bits of <strong>binary</strong> can be added by full-added but then add 0110, in order to convert to** BCD.** It's a regular formula you can find by yourself through their truth tables, and you will find two of four bits of binary added compares with BCD are just different <strong>over 9 number</strong>.(01001)--&gt;binary(01001)--&gt;BCD<br>
10 number(01010)-&gt;binary(10000)--&gt;BCD<br>
below are the knowledge I learned in the evening.</p>
